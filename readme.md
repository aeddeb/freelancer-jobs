# Freelancer Job Market Analysis

### **Description**: In this project, I wanted to explore the freelancer job market. I wanted to get an idea of what are most freelancer jobs out there and how competitive the market is. Additionally, as a data scientist, I wanted to further inspect data related jobs and explore what were the most requested jobs on the market.

#### Below I describe the steps completed in this project and relay insights. 

## A. Data Collection
18,706 freelancer jobs were scraped from freelancer.com on Sept 03, 2020 and the scraper, scrape.py, is located in the scripts directory.

## B. Data Cleaning
Initial cleaning of the data was completed in the 1_data_cleaning.ipynb notebook. Then the cleaning steps were functionalized into a script, clean.py, which is located in the scripts directory.

## C. Data EDA
Data exploration was divided into exploring numeric variables and non-numeric variables separately. Numeric variables were explored in the 2a_data_eda.ipynb notebook and non-numeric variables were explored in the 2b_data_eda.ipynb notebook.
